Unfortunately, my wish for restful sleep was not granted. The both of us kept waking up in the middle of the night. We gave up trying to go back to sleep around 6:00 am, then walked to a nearby 7-Eleven to have a look at the breakfast items. Let me tell you, 7-Eleven in Japan is in a whole other league when it comes to food!

After breakfast, our first order of business was to pay a visit to Senso-ji Temple. While we were more confident in our ability to navigate the train system, the closest station to the temple was on a private line, the Tsukuba Express. Since our JR Passes didn’t cover this line, we opted to buy a Suica[^2] card. Luckily, the woman at the information booth in Akihabara station spoke perfect English. She promptly directed us to where we could purchase a Suica card. Almost everyone in Japan uses IC cards for trains, so it was easy to pick up how to use them.

After arriving at our destination, we walked through a sea of vendors selling all kinds of food and souvenirs.

The temple and pagoda were absolutely gorgeous. Hollie and I both cleansed ourselves at the well before each making a quick prayer in the temple.

Next, we made a quick detour to Kappabashi[^3] since we were in the area. Hollie ended up buying a couple of small things. Even though I didn’t end up purchasing anything, it was interesting to see the wealth of restaurant grade items available to Japanese chefs. In particular, the plastic food models were really fun to browse through. They are extremely common in restaurant window displays.

The next stop on our list was Akihabara[^4]! We had a little trouble finding exactly where we wanted to go since we didn’t know the name of any streets. We stumbled upon the Square Enix and Gundam cafes while wandering around. We also did a brief walk through Yodobashi-Akiba, which is a **huge** electronics store. It was absolutely incredible. If I lived in Tokyo, I would definitely buy all of my electronics there. I could see myself browsing there for hours on end!

In due time we found the main strip of Akihabara, with all the anime merchandise that you could ever dream of. One of the things that stood out was all the prize machines with exclusive merch. I gave one of the machines a shot, but couldn't win the figure I was hoping for. I’ll definitely have to practice playing those prize games for my next trip!

After browsing a few shops, the two of us got hungry and made our way to Mononopu. Mononopu is a _Sengoku[^5]_ era themed maid cafe. Our maid was “Honda Tone.” I had to ask her who that was, since all the maids are based on famous _daimyo[^6]_. As it turns out, Tone is one of Honda Tadakatsu’s[^7] sons. Powering through the language barrier, Tone, Hollie, and I stumbled through some small talk using as much Japanglish as we could muster. Tone did seem very impressed with how much Japanese we knew, and especially how much Japanese history I am familiar with.

For my first visit to a maid cafe, I had live out the cliche. I ordered an _omuraisu_ with something written in ketchup. Before I could dig in, Tone had us cast a "magic spell" on the food. Since I wasn't quite sure what she meant, I asked if it was similar to _"Moe Moe Kyun[^8]?"_ Tone jumped up and down exclaiming "Yes!" She was very surprised that we were familiar with _Moe Moe Kyun_, but then told us they have a different spell at Mononopu. Unfortunately I can't remember the spell. After casting it, I was able to enjoy my _omuraisu_, but not before taking a photo! The drawings were so cute I had a hard time convincing myself to eat it!

After lunch, we did a bit more browsing around Akihabara.

The last shop we went to before calling it a night was the Mandarake Complex. I was dead set on getting a copy of _Fate/Stay Night[^9]_ on PC. I tried looking for it myself, but ended up having to ask one of the employees for help. I pulled up a picture of the game cover on my phone so there wouldn’t be any misunderstanding. He knew exactly what I meant and grabbed a copy from the back room.

He then immediately took the game out of the plastic wrap. Internally I started freaking out! “Why would he take the plastic off?!”

The reason turned out to be since it was a used copy, he had to show me the damage to the case and disc. Phew! I already played the English patched version of the game, so I didn’t really care what condition it was in. I just love the game so much I wanted a physical copy. I’m overjoyed I was finally able to get one!

Hollie wanted to buy a certain manga, so we went to the floor in the Mandarake Complex where we had previously seen manga. Not knowing how to read Japanese, neither of us had any idea how the books are organized, so we had to ask for help. The manga she was looking for is a _yaoi[^10]_ manga, and apparently, there’s a completely different floor for _yaoi_. The employee kind of chuckled, then directed us to the correct floor. After getting some assistance from another employee, Hollie got her manga.

With our loot in hand, we headed home for the day feeling accomplished!
