After an unbearably long flight, albeit with some decent food, Hollie and I landed in Tokyo around 5:30 pm.

Going through customs was a breeze. Finding the airport post office, on the other hand, proved more time consuming. We did eventually find it after ten or twenty minutes of searching. I picked up the pocket WiFi I reserved through eConnect at the post office. Now the only thing left to do before we left the airport was get our JR Passes[^1]! 

The woman who helped us obtain our JR Passes was extremely accomodating. We felt awful when she asked where we were staying, and we had to take up some of her time to look up the address. Despite that, she went above and beyond while assisting us. She even went so far as to Google our hotel and give step-by-step directions, such as which trains to take and where we needed to transfer.

We took the Narita Express to Tokyo station. From there, it was only two short train rides to our hotel in Asakusabashi. 

Our hotel room ended up being smaller than expected, with only one twin-sized bed. After the arduous day of travel, I struggled to keep my eyes open, but had a difficult time falling asleep. All I could hope for was that the small amount of sleep I was about to get would be deep and restful.

[^1]: A railway pass only available to foreign tourists. It works on almost all JR railways, including many city lines. The main advantage is how cheap it makes intercity travel on bullet trains.
