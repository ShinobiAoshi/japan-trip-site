For our last day in Tokyo, we thought we'd get very cultural.

First on our agenda was to pay a visit to the Tokyo Imperial Palace. Unfortunately the palace itself is closed to the public, except for a select few that apply for a tour beforehand. We didn't. However, the grounds are open to the public.

While this was technically our second time at Tokyo Station, the first time we were just passing through and anxious to get to our hotel from the airport. This time we got to really explore the station.

Right outside the exit, we noticed a large gathering of people and what looked like some sort of ceremony going on. There were guards (not sure if they were police) mounted on horseback escorting a carriage. The entire ceremony lasted somewhere between five and ten minutes. I assume some foreign diplomat was escorted to the palace.

From the plaza, it was just a short walk to the palace grounds. The area was ripe with tourists, doing their best to take photos of the various palace structures. While the exterior of the palace was a spectacle on it's own, it would have been nice to tour the interior. To get a small glimpse into the life of the Emperor.

After circling the grounds, Hollie and I made our way to the Tokyo National Museum in Ueno. As an aside, Ueno Park looks like **_THE_** place for cherry blossom viewing. It's a real shame we were a few weeks early to catch them in full bloom, but on the other hand I'm thankful we visited when we did. I hear cherry blossom season is insanely busy.

The Tokyo National Museum has the largest collection of Japanese historical artifacts in the world. The collection includes a wide range of objects like ancient wood carvings, pottery, paintings, calligraphy, wardrobes, swords, and statues. It was a fascinating look through history. As varied as the exhibits were, you are still left with the impression that there is so much more to explore.

Learning about hundreds of years of history worked up an appetite. We found a sushi spot close to the owl cafe since our 4:00 pm booking was quickly approaching. It was our first _kaiten-zushi[^1]_ restaurant, and boy did it deliver! After being shown to your seat, all you need to do is use a touch screen tablet (which had an English menu, thank goodness!) to order individual plates. In addition to the large selection of sushi, there were also some unexpected side items like french fries and various desserts. What surprised us the most was that the items you ordered were delivered directly to your seat on the conveyor belt! No waiting around for your items to make their way slowly across the entire belt. They go directly to you! There is even a notification on your tablet when your item is waiting to be picked up in front of you. Since you do all the ordering on the tablet, when you want to pay for your meal, the tablet automatically calculates your total and prints your check. You take the check to the cashier at the front and you're done! I'm convinced this is the future of restaurants. So little social interaction needed!

Feeling very satisfied with our meal, Hollie and I made our way to the owl cafe in Shibuya. It was a quaint little space on the fourth floor of some building. I believe our session was fully booked, with about seven people total. Included in the entry price is a drink of your choice. I got apple juice. I can never get enough of Japanese apple juice! It actually tastes like biting into an apple, as opposed to drinking apple flavored corn syrup. The first fifteen minutes of the hour long session is "rest time" for the owls, and the staff explain the rules while you enjoy your drinks.

When it came time to go into the owl area, I decided to lag behind to avoid the rush. What I didn't know is that would be my only chance to enter the owl area, so unfortunately I missed out on interacting with any owls. A part of me is relieved since I still have a fear of birds, but I do regret not taking advantage of the opportunity. Hollie had a blast though. She got to feed a few of the owls and even held some on her arm with a protective glove.

With our time in Tokyo rapidly coming to an end, we decided to spend our last couple of hours shopping in Akihabara since it's very close to our hotel. Up to this point we hadn't seen much of Tokyo at night. We had been on such an early morning schedule that by sundown we were completely beat and getting ready for bed.
