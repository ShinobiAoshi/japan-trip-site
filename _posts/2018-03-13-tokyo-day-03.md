After the severe disappointment of the Ufotable Cafe being closed on Monday, we decided to give the cafe another shot.

We had a rather slow start to the day, realizing we didn't need to rush out the door. We wanted to have lunch at the cafe, so we didn't leave the hotel until about 10:00 am.

Upon reaching our destination, I promptly walked in the door and was surprised by what followed. I was shoo'd out the door (as politely as possible). After a few moments of confusion, I was met outside by a waitress holding a menu and some numbered cards. She spoke to me entirely in Japanese, and unfortunately I couldn't piece together what she was saying. She showed me both sides of the menu (one side was a _Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel[^1]_ theme, and the other a _Today's Menu for Emiya-san's Family[^2]_ theme). I had no idea what she was saying, so I guessed that she was asking me to pick a theme (My thought process was maybe there are different sections in the cafe depending on the theme, and that's why you need to pick one). I uttered "Heaven's Feel," which was followed by a look I can only describe as a mix of pity and confusion. It was evident that's not even close to the answer she was looking for. At this point I think the waitress realized I had no idea what was going on, then handed me a numbered ticket with the 11:30 am - 1:00 pm time slot written on it.

Hollie and I rested at a nearby park bench for about half an hour before making our way back to the cafe.

There were about twenty people lined up outside the cafe, so Hollie and I queued up behind them. At exactly 11:30 am, we were escorted into the cafe and seated at our assigned table. There were about half a dozen large cardboard cut-outs of various _Fate_ characters throughout the cafe. A decent chunk of the cafe was a dedicated shop, with a wide variety of novelty items, like a _Gae Bolg[^3]_ letter opener, some character themed pint glasses, and plenty of posters. Most impressively, there was a large exhibit displaying actual key frames drawn for notable scenes in the _Heaven's Feel_ movie. Sadly, no photography was allowed of the exhibit.

To place an order, we were given a sheet of paper with the menu items written out (entirely in Japanese, with no pictures), and you had to put a checkmark next to the items you wanted to order. Thankfully, the Google Translate app was able to help us out with the menu.

Hollie and I both got a fruity drink (non-alcoholic), which tasted mostly like cranberry juice with some light carbonation. Hollie didn't get an entree, instead going straight to a parfait for dessert. I ordered the _mapo tofu[^4]_ with a side of rice, as well as a fruity crepe for dessert. When our waitress came to pick up the sheet of paper with our selections, she asked me a question in Japanese. I couldn't understand enough of the question to derive what she meant, so upon seeing my dazed look of confusion, she asked me English, "with or after?" then pointed to the dessert I ordered on the menu. I immediately understood and said I wanted the dessert after my meal. 

All the food was exquisite!

After admiring the key frame exhibit and purchasing a few small items, we exited the cafe and headed toward Shibuya on a full stomache.

We witnessed the famous Shibuya Crossing, the busiest intersection in Japan. I read that the best view is from the second floor of a nearby Starbucks overlooking the intersection, but it looked extremely crowded. We didn't want to go through the hassle.

There were a lot of shops nearby, so Hollie and I looked around a little. A coffee shop caught Hollie's eye, and we stepped in for a quick snack and some tea. There were no seats downstairs, so we headed to the second floor. Turns out, the second floor is the smoking section. It was a little bit of a shock, coming from the US where smoking is illegal in almost all public places.

After the pit stop, the last thing on our agenda for the day was to visit Meiji Shrine. It was a quick train ride from Shibuya to Harajuku station. Right outside Harajuku station is a famous street, known for fashion, named Takeshita. Since the street was right across from the station we took a quick peek, then headed toward the shrine.

The shrine is located in the middle of a beautiful park. If not for the railway noise, you might even forget you're in the middle of Tokyo. After admiring the entrance gate, and a leisurely stroll through the park, we arrived at the main building of the shrine. Hollie and I were tempted to buy some _ema[^5]_, but decided to do it another time.

After we got back to the hotel, hunger creeped up on us. We figured this is as good a time as any to eat at a Japanese McDonalds. We took an evening stroll to the nearest one.

While many elements were familiar, it was a little odd feeling out of place as an American at a McDonalds. The menu is different, not to mention in another language. When we ordered we had to point at what we wanted on a flat menu at the counter. I ordered a Teriyaki Burger and an Egg Burger. I wanted to try the Japan exclusive items! Hollie got a Shrimp Croquette Sandwich.

After our meal, we wanted to take advantage of the food coma for a good night's sleep!
