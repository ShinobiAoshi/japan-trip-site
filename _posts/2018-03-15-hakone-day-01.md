title: Hakone, Day 1
subtitle: Journey to Hakone

Excited about our first ride on a _shinkansen[^1]_, the both of us eagerly lined up on the platform for our train. It took us a little while to figure out how to determine if a car is a _green car[^2]_, or if it has reserved or non-reserved seating. After a couple of minutes we noticed a display near the tracks that informs you which cars on the arriving train are non-reserved. Once we figured that out, boarding was no problem.

After a smooth hour long ride, we arrived in Hakone! Both of us were eager to check in to our hotel, but we arrived earlier than the check-in time of 3:00 pm. Fortunately our hotel offered to hold our baggage for us while we explored the town until it was time to check-in.

Hakone was a nice change of pace from Tokyo. Fewer people, a relaxed vibe, and gorgeous natural scenery to take in. The sound of a nearby river was especially refreshing. It was enjoyable checking out all the little shops and restaurants nearby. Hollie and I were surprised at how many fellow travelers were walking around in their _yukatas[^3]_.

When it came time to check-in, we were kindly escorted to our room. The hotel staff member explained the various amenities available to us, and asked us a bit about where we're from. We stayed at a _ryokan[^4]_, so the entire room was very minimal with only a table and some pillows atop a _tatami_ mat floor.

We had a bit of time before dinner was to be served, so we went back out into town. This is when we noticed the whole place seemed to get significantly more active, with plenty of other travelers looking to get away. The souvenir shops were especially busy, selling a lot of regional specialties such as _onsen manju[^5]_. One shop that stood out to me in particular was a _Neon Genesis Evangelion[^6]_ themed shop. It was just odd to find it here of all places instead of Akihabara.

Our ryokan hosts served us an extremely upscale dinner, most of which I couldn't tell you what it was. I ate almost everything, except for the crawfish _sashimi_, and the crab in the hotpot. As adventurous as I told myself I would be, I just couldn't bring myself to eat them.

When we finished dinner, a staff member came to clear the table. After waiting to digest a little, it was finally time to take a bath in the _onsen[^7]_! Hollie reserved a private bath for the night, so she headed there. Meanwhile, I had to summon the courage to go to the public bath. It was moderately uncomfortable with a few other guests using the bath, and the fact I'm not accustomed to washing myself while sitting[^8]. Once I got through that, the _onsen_ was heavenly! It was a struggle to admit to myself when I needed to get out, but the water is too hot to stay in for long periods of time.

Hollie had a much less pleasant time. The private bath she booked is outdoors, and it was very windy thaâ€  night. She said she was freezing whenever she wasn't in the bath, and even while _in_ the bath, the wind was so strong the water would splash all around.

After recounting our mixed bathing experiences, it was time to call it a night.
