For our first day in Kyoto, Hollie and I wanted to focus on the historical aspect of the city. There is an almost endless number of historically significant sites, shrines, and temples to explore. However, due to our limited time, we had to choose only the best of the best to go see.

First up on our list had to be _Kinkaku-ji[^1]_. While trying to get to the temple, we realized how spoiled we had been with Tokyo's railway system. Kyoto was far more difficult to navigate. We had to rely on buses. Keep in mind neither of us had ever ridden a public bus before, then add a major language barrier on top of that. Thankfully, we were able to figure out a route using Google Maps. Once we located the correct bus stop, we also looked up how Japanese buses work, things like how to pay, common courtesies, etc. Buses in Japan are apparently quite varied in how they operate.

The bus we got on had an IC Card reader, similar to the train stations. All we had to do was scan in when we got on, then scan again on our way out. The fare is automatically deducted from your card. After about a twenty minute bus ride we got to the pavillion site! Since it's such a huge tourist attraction, there were many shops selling various souvenirs right outside.

There was a five-hundred yen admission fee to get into the grounds. The place was packed, but _Kinkaku-ji_ was worth the money and fighting the crowds. The building is absolutely stunning, and from certain angles almost looks like it's floating on the water. After wiggling through the mob of tourists fighting for selfie opportunities, we made our way around the remainder of the grounds.

Seeing as this was a warm day, and it's a local specialty, Hollie and I opted to get some green tea flavored ice cream with gold flakes sprinkled on top. The ice cream tasted pretty much as described, and the gold flakes were a fun novelty.

Our next destination was none other than the Kyoto Imperial Palace. The palace was only recently opened up for visitors to explore without needing a reservation. While the palace we visited in Tokyo is the current residence of the emperor, Kyoto was the capital of Japan from 1180-1868. The palace is surrounded by a huge park open to the public, so we enjoyed the opportunity to take in some nice scenery during our walk to the palace.

Even though the interior of every building on the premise is off-limits, the palace was still a spectacle of Japanese architecture and grandeur. Every detail of the palace was designed to impress guests and host huge ceremonies. One thing that stuck out to me was the fact that visitors who needed an audience with the emperor were shown to different rooms. These rooms varied in size and amenities based on the status of the guest.

Equally as impressive as the palace, was the imperial garden. I can imagine it was a wonderful place to relax and collect one's thoughts. Most of it was closed off unfortunately.

After touring the palace, we walked through the rest of the surrounding park on our way to Honno-ji temple. There was a lovely walkway lined with _sakura[^2]_ trees that were beginning to bud. Even if they weren't in full bloom, they were still quite beautiful. So much so that there were dozens of people taking photos (Hollie and I included).

Being a slight Japanese history buff, I was thrilled to see Honno-ji Temple. It's where one of the most famous warlords in Japan, Nobunaga Oda, was betrayed by one of his retainers. Oda was forced to commit _seppuku[^3]_ during the attack at Honno-ji Temple. When we entered the main building, a buddhist monk was giving a history lecture about the temple. I found it funny that as soon as Hollie and I walked in, the monk handed us an English guide so we could follow along.

After exiting the temple, there was a group of locals dressed up in samurai outfits offering photo opportunities to visitors. Hollie convinced me to take them up on their offer.

Since _Teramachi Street[^4]_ was right next to Honno-ji Temple, we thought we would do some quick shopping before heading home for the day. I, of course, got sucked into an anime shop for way too long. The shop had tons of _Fate_ (my favorite anime franchise) merchandise, so I couldn't help myself. Before too long hunger crept up on both of us, so we made our way through the rest of Teramachi quickly.

We found a curry restaurant on our way back to the house, and decided to eat there. It got very chilly at night, so a hot meal was exactly what we needed. It was the absolute **best** curry either of us have ever had. The sauce had a great spiciness to it without being overpowering, and the chicken _katsu[^5]_ was cooked to perfection. We loved it so much we decided we would definitely eat there again.
