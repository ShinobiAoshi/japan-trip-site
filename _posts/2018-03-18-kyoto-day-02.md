We started off the day with a quick ride over to the Arashiyama district of Kyoto. Almost everyone on the train with us got off at the Arashiyama station, then walked the same direction. Hollie and I figured they were all here for the same reason as us, so we followed the crowd.

We were right! They saved us the trouble of finding the bamboo forest on Google Maps. The trail through the bamboo forest was filled with people shoulder to shoulder. I was almost tempted to pay for a cart ride. The carts go on a separate trail, so I assumed there would be better photo opportunities. Miraculously we found a fantastic photo opportunity, and took advantage. The bamboo forest was breathtaking. I can imagine the walk would be relaxing and tranquil if not for the crowd, but that's Japan for you.

A short walk from the bamboo forest was the next destination on our agenda, Iwatayama Monkey Park. What we didn't know, however, is how strenuous the walk up the mountain to the park would be. There was a small admission fee at the foot of the mountain. From there, it was an estimated forty minute walk to the park. It took some pep talking from each of us, but we embarked on the climb! I thought that after all the walking we have been doing while sight-seeing for this whole trip, maybe the climb wouldn't be so bad. I was wrong. I'm so thankful for the benches (surprisingly rare in Japan) along the trail. The majority of visitors we encountered along the way were foreigners, so there were some mutual greetings and small talk about the climb.

We did eventually get to the monkey park. From the park there was a spectacular view of Kyoto that I couldn't resist photographing. While there are over one hundred monkeys in park, we only saw a few dozen or so. The rest were probably in the surrounding trees and out of sight. There were very explicit rules about not touching the monkeys, not getting within three meters of them, not making eye contact, and especially no feeding them. Hollie and I were sure to keep our distance. There is a feeding area where you can pay for some food and feed the monkeys through a fence if you're so inclined. We observed the monkeys for a while, even witnessing a few small fights between them. Then it came time to descend the mountain. Naturally the walk down wasn't near as taxing as the walk up.

Following the hike, a relaxing train ride to Nara was a welcome change of pace. What we didn't realize was that Nara Park is a long walk from the station. After getting a quick caffeine fix from a nearby Starbucks, we headed out! When we arrived, we found the park brimming with deer! The deer are one of the main attractions. Nearly every shop sells crackers that you can feed to the deer, and the deer know it. They will walk right up to you without a care in the world if you have something in your hand.

It's also evidently very popular to take a selfie with the deer. We saw dozens of people do just that. While the deer were a big part of why we went to the park, there were a couple of temples that I wanted to check out as well. We made a quick detour over to Kokufu-ji Temple, which had one of the most impressive pagodas we had seen yet. I don't think the photo does it justice.

Lastly, there's the main attraction of Nara Park, Todai-ji Temple. This was another instance of a place to popular you could follow the crowd to find it. Even the gate preceding the temple was impressive, an imposing _nio[^1]_ on each side. When we got to the main temple, we were stunned at the scale of it. Again, the photo doesn't do it justice! There was an admission fee to actually enter the temple, but with the monkey park and the long walk in Nara, we were content with seeing Todai-ji from afar, then heading to back to Kyoto.

After such an exhausting day, I was ready for a good meal. Kazu, our AirBnB host, suggested a ramen place near his house, so we gave it a try. It was the first time I had _shoyu[^2]_ ramen. After how delicious it was, it won't be my last! I thoroughly enjoyed the bowl, even going so far as to drink all the broth. With a full stomach and tired feet, we retired for the night.
