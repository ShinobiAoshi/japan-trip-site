Since it was a clear day with beautiful weather, Hollie and I decided it was the perfect morning to go to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building observation deck. When we got there it was obvious how popular the spot is with tourists. There was a line to ride the elevator up, and most of the visitors were foreigners.

The view from the deck was stunning. It's hard to comprehend how massive and populous Tokyo is until you get up there. All you can see is skyscrapers in every direction. Even though it was a fairly clear day, we weren’t able to get a picture perfect view of Mt. Fuji. We could definitely make the mountain out in the distance, but the haze made it difficult to capture on camera.

Next up on our list (and my personal top thing to do in Japan) was to get lunch at the Ufotable Cafe[^1] in Nakano. To our dismay, the cafe was a twenty minute walk from the nearest station. However, it was nice to see a more suburban side of Tokyo in Nakano while we walked. Then the worst happened. It turns out the cafe is closed on Mondays. All that travel for nothing!

Luckily, there’s a huge shopping complex in Nakano called Nakano Broadway. We went through Nakano Broadway, where a ramen shop caught our attention. It was slightly embarrasing, because when we walked in, we went straight to finding a seat. However, it's common in ramen shops these days to have a ticket machine at the entrance that you use to place an order. One of the employees quickly corrected our mistake. The ramen was extremely tasty, and exactly the type of meal I needed after the cafe disappointment.

With our hunger sated, we did a bit more browsing around Nakano Broadway, then headed back to Shinjuku to experience a samurai museum.

While walking to the museum, we heard the distinctive roar of Godzilla! Turns out we wandered right under a giant Godzilla head prop that sits atop a movie theater. For some reason we didn’t get any pictures of it though. Definitely regret that.

The samurai museum was fascinating. Hollie really appreciated that the museum caters to foreigners and doesn't assume any knowledge of Japanese history for the tour. I read a lot of Japanese history because of my interest in samurai, so I wished the tour was a little more in depth. I did learn some new things though! Apparently Nobunaga Oda’s[^2] armor was the inspiration behind Darth Vader’s look! Near the end of the tour we were treated to a sword fighting demonstration from someone whose been practicing _kendo[^3]_ for over ten years.

After all the walking in Nakano, we were really worn out. We called it a day at the end of the museum tour.
