subtitle: Journey to Fukui

Since Hollie and I did almost all of our packing the night before, we were easily able to check out of our AirBnB by 10:00 am.

Our next destination was Fukui. One of Hollie's best friends, Sarah, has a job in Fukui teaching English. She was kind enough to let me stay in her apartment for a night. Hollie was going to be staying with Sarah for an additional week after I left. 

While Hollie and I were walking to the track for the train we were taking to Fukui, and older Japanese gentleman politely asked us if we had a few minutes to spare to help him practice his English. Our train didn't depart for another ten minutes, so we were happy to oblige. He told us he needed to learn English while he was working, but he doesn't want his English skills to get rusty now that he is retired. We exchanged small talk, where we were from, what we've done in Japan so far, things like that. When our train arrived at the station, we said goodbye, and he thanked us for our time.

The train was packed, so unfortunately Hollie and I couldn't sit together. This train wasn't a _shinkansen_, and didn't have much leg room. Having to keep my luggage in front of me for the whole two hour ride was uncomfortable, but you do what you have to do. On the bright side, the ride to Fukui was beautiful. Fukui is much more rural than Tokyo or Kyoto, so there was plenty of natural scenery to enjoy along the way.

From the nearest station we didn't have any trouble finding Sarah's apartment, though dragging our luggage around was cumbersome. Sarah had work until 5:00 pm, so Hollie and I had the apartment to ourselves for a few hours. We worked up an appetite on the way there, and decided to eat at a cafe we had passed by. The cafe had a fancy feel to it. Hollie couldn't have been more excited to try one of their soufle pancakes, so naturally that's what she ordered. The cafe had an omelette special which included coffee, so I got that.

My omelette! I couldn't read the menu, so I'm not sure, but the sauce tasted like lobster bisque to me.

After the leisurely meal, we went to a nearby bakery. Hollie and I wanted to give Sarah something sweet as a thank you for letting us stay with her. The bakery had some very interesting items to say the least. We ended up buying a roll cake, mostly because Hollie and I really wanted one. Sarah doesn't have to know!

Since we still had some time to kill before Sarah got home, we started watching Friends on Netflix. It had been an eventful two weeks up to this point, so we were happy to have a lazy day.

When Sarah did get home, we exchanged greetings. The subject quickly changed to dinner. Sarah mentioned a burger joint she loved, so collectively we decided to eat there. The greatest thing was Sarah was able to **drive** us there! The place was a bit far, but none of us minded since we had plenty to talk about. As an added bonus, we got to see a lot of the city!

The burger joint was quaint, but it was obvious the owner takes a lot of pride in it. I can vouch for the authenticity, there was a Texas flag and everything! I ended up ordering the Texas Chili-Cheeseburger and fries. While it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, it was pretty damn good. 

When we got back to the apartment after dinner, we continued to catch up with each other. It seemed like no time had passed at all until suddenly we couldn't stop yawning and had to call it a night. I slept in the guest room on a futon Sarah bought for us. Hollie slept on the couch. She was still not a fan of sleeping on the floor.
