With all the travel time ahead of us, we woke up early and ate the breakfast we grabbed the night before. Our goals for the day were to visit Himeji, Miyajima, and Hiroshima.

The _shinkansen_ ride from Kyoto to Himeji took about an hour. There is a slightly faster line to Himeji, but it's not covered by the JR Pass. We had to be careful to not accidentally board it! 

Himeji is famous for having the most well preserved and beautiful Japanese castle. From Himeji station, the castle was about a twenty minute walk. While Osaka Castle was impressive, I'll admit it doesn't compare to Himeji Castle. Once you step inside the walls of the castle grounds, it really feels like you're in feudal Japan with how well preserved the entire complex is. After some great photo ops, it was time to actually explore the castle keep!

Unlike Osaka Castle, Himeji Castle has been largely untouched for over four hundred years. To enter the keep, all visitors had to take their shoes off. They did have staff handing out plastic bags so you could carry your shoes with you. It was raining heavily that day, so I'm unsure if they always give you a bag, or if that was only because of the weather.

There were some posted signs throughout the tour to educate you about the castle. One thing I found particularly impressive was the fact there is an an AR (Augmented Reality) app to supplement the tour! There are spots in the castle where you can point your phone camera, and a short educational video would play. My favorite use of the app was at the top floor of the keep. It showed a 3D rendering of the city, as it looked in the 1600s. The rendering even updated in real time as you rotated!

After exiting the main keep, the path takes you to a well haunted by the ghost of a servant named Okiku. The story of Okiku's death is a very popular Japanese play. It is said that every night, the ghost appears, counts to nine, then wails unnaturally. Thankfully we visited during the day!

I wonder how many yen are at the bottom of the well?

After appreciating our step back in time, Hollie and I returned to the station to catch our ride to Hiroshima. We missed the train by a couple of minutes, then quickly came to realize the huge mistake we made. We were used to trains, even _shinkansen_, coming at most every fifteen minutes or so. It turned out that the next train to Hiroshima from Himeji wouldn't arrive for another hour! This threw all of our plans off. Hiroshima was still about a two hour train ride from Himeji, and the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum closes at 6:00 pm.

After killing an hour at a bookstore in the station, we got on the train to Hiroshima. At this point we were thinking it would be close, but that we would be able to visit Miyajima, then make it to the museum before it closed. We decided to go to Miyajima first, since the sun goes down early, and we wanted to be able to appreciate the scenery in the daylight.

Miyajima is an island, home to one of the most iconic structures in Japan, the great floating _torii_ gate of Itsukushima Shrine. In order to get there, you need to take a half-hour ferry ride. Luckily that ferry ride is covered by the JR Pass! Hollie and I rushed from the train station to the ferry dock. We made it just in time! The ferry ride gave a breathtaking view of the island. With the clouds kissing the lush green mountainsides, it looked like a scene straight out of a fantasy book.

The floating torii gate! Shame we happened to go during low tide

After disembarking the ferry, we scrambled over to the shrine. Miyajima, similarly to Nara, is famous for deer. There were plenty of deer out and about despite the rain. When we got to the _torii_ gate, the tide was very low. On one hand this meant we could walk right up to the gate, but on the other it meant we didn't get to see the "floating" gate. After a quick visit to the shrine, we hurried back toward the ferry still hoping to make it to the museum. Being such a popular tourist location, the island is filled with little shops along the way. We took the opportunity to try a Miyajima specialty, _momiji manju[^1]_. Each of us got one filled with custard. The _momiji manju_ were very tasty!

We did manage to catch a ferry at the perfect time, but after looking up a route to the museum on Google Maps, I realized we wouldn't make it in time. The museum was too far away from any train stations. The walk or bus ride would take too long. Hollie and I did decide to at least visit the Memorial Park, which is always open. After arriving at the nearest train station, it took us a while to figure out how to get to the park. Walking would take too long, so the best option was using the streetcar. There was no English at all on the schedule, or even English labels for the stops. That's why it took us some time to figure out.

We did eventually make it to the park. Viewing the _Genbaku Dome[^2]_ in person is chilling, doubly so as an American. It is amazing how, apart from the dome, you would never guess the city was reduced to nothing less than eighty years ago by an atomic bomb.

At this point the sun was down, the wind and rain had picked up, and we were both freezing cold. Despite that, we still had a long commute back to Kyoto, so we didn't spend much time at the park. I'm glad we at least made time to see the dome.

It was a quiet ride back to Kyoto with how tired Hollie and I were. We were both disappointed that the day didn't go exactly like we wanted it to. Despite that, we experienced a lot of amazing things, and made great memories along the way. I think we were both dreading having to pack when we got back to Kyoto. This was our final night there, and we had to check out by 10:00 am the next morning. We did somehow find the energy to pack, then talked about how much we'll miss the _kotatsu_ before drifting off to sleep.

[^2]: Atomic Bomb Dome. Formerly serving as the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, it was the only building left standing near the atomic bomb's hypocenter. It was preserved to honor those that died during the bombing, and to serve as a reminder about the horror atomic warfare leaves behind.
