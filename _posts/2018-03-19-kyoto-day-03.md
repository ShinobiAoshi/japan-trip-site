title: Kyoto, Day 3
subtitle: Fushimi Inari Shrine, Higashiyama District
---
Since we still had two day trips planned during our visit, this was our last day to experience Kyoto. A trip to Kyoto wouldn't be complete without seeing the Fushimi Inari Shrine, so that's what we set out to see!

We were very thankful that the shrine was right across from the station, after all the walking we had to do in Nara the day before. Being one of the most popular tourist sites in Kyoto, the shrine was bustling with visitors and shops. Hollie and I did a little browsing before making our way to the main building. I was tempted to get a miniature _torii_ gate to decorate my apartment with, but decided against it due to the difficulty of transporting it back home.

This shrine is the most important shrine dedicated to the god _Inari[^1]_. Foxes are believed to be Inari's messengers, and because of that, there are numerous fox statues throughout the grounds.

The Romon Gate, donated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589, awes visitors at the entrance of the shrine. Behind the main building is where the shrine's most famous attraction, the _Senbon Torii[^2]_ trail lies. Due to Inari's popularity, individuals and groups alike have made thousands of _torii_ gate donations throughout the shrine's long history.

Walking through the trail you can't help but be overwhelmed with astonishment. The gates are one of Japan's most iconic scenes for a reason. Seeing nothing but gates as far as the eye can see along the trail gives you a feeling that I don't think can be captured by viewing a photo. We did get some great photos though, despite the huge crowds!

Sticking to old school Kyoto, our next destination was the Higashiyama district. It is one of the most well preserved historic districts in the city. This was quite a walk from the nearest station for us. When we started to spot dozens of people walking around in _kimonos_, we knew we were in the right place.

The streets are lined with small shops and restaurants. They embody traditional Japanese design, helping you feel like you're back in the old capital. We headed up the street toward Kiyomizudera Temple, doing plenty of window shopping along the way. The rainy weather, and the fact this was a steep uphill climb, took some of the enjoyment out of exploring the area. The sea of umbrellas made it difficult to take in much of the scenery, and by the time we got to the temple we were completely worn out.

We rested for a while at the temple, then looked through a nearby souvenir shop selling snacks. After Hollie purchased some Kyoto-themed cookies, we descended the hill and headed home for the day.
