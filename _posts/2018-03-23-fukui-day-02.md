title: Fukui, Day 2
subtitle: Returning Home
---
While I knew this day had to come eventually, it didn't make it any less bittersweet. My last day in Japan.

Since my flight wasn't until late at night, I had some time to hang out in Fukui before I needed to make my way to Tokyo. Through a stroke of sheer luck, Sarah only had to work a half day, and we were all able to go out to lunch together. Fukui is known for their sauce _katsudon[^1]_, so naturally we had to try it!

I am so glad I decided to stay in Fukui for lunch, because the sauce _katsudon_ was delicious! It really hit the spot.

After lunch, Sarah dropped me off at the station where we said our goodbyes. It was about a four hour commute to get back to Tokyo. One of the _shinkansen_ I needed to ride had reserved seating only. Every _shinkansen_ I had been on prior to this one had non-reserved seating, so this was new to me. Thankfully seat reservations are free with a JR Pass, and it wasn't much of a hassle to reserve a seat.

I made it to Haneda Airport without any issues, and with time to spare. After confirming the airport had free WiFi, I found a mailbox to return the pocket WiFi I rented. Next, I checked my bag in at the counter, then went looking for what would be my last meal in Japan.

I came across a Chinese food place that had _mapo tofu_ on the menu, and couldn't resist. It was by far the best _mapo tofu_ I have ever had, blowing every previous bowl out of the water!

With dinner sitting firmly in my belly, there was nothing left to do but wait at my gate and board my flight. The flight was as uncomfortable as ever, but thankfully the return flight was shorter than the arrival flight.

Getting through customs at LAX took a lot longer than I thought it would, just due to how many people were there. I was very glad I gave myself plenty of time between flights. I only had about thirty minutes to wait at the gate for my Austin flight when all was said and done. At this point I couldn't wait to get home and sleep. I had been awake for over twenty-four hours. 

My flight went smoothly. I hurriedly picked up my suitcase from baggage claim, and bolted out to the pick up zone. A friend gave me a ride home. Shortly after showering, I hit my bed like a ton of bricks.
